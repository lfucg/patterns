The Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government communications manual and style guide provides specific rules and usages that are to be followed by all employees of the LFUCG.

Please keep in mind that very often, the public judges an organization by the quality and consistency of its communications. Therefore, it is critical that the LFUCG present a clean and consistent look to the public.

With more than 40 divisions, it would be impossible for the Division of Government Communications to review every document before it is sent out. The following guidelines are intended to help you in your communication to your audience. They are not meant to hinder your work. They are here to help ensure the success of your project. These guidelines should be applied daily to ensure accuracy, consistency and timeliness in relaying information to employees, departments/divisions, representatives of the media and the public at large.

These guidelines conform largely to the Associated Press Stylebook and the Chicago Manual of Style.

Thank you for your cooperation. Should you have any questions, please contact someone in the Office of Public Information.
