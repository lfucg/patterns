* In general, confine capitalization to formal titles used directly before an individual's name:  _Councilmember Joseph P. Yancey, Mayor Jacqueline J. Brown_
* Lowercase and spell out titles when they are not used with or in front of an individual's name:  _The mayor spoke to the press earlier today._
* Lowercase and spell out titles when they are separated from the person's name by commas:  _The chief administrative officer, Sally Smith, spoke to the press earlier today._
