title: Times and Dates

* Use figures for time, except noon and midnight: _9:30 a.m. – noon or midnight – 6 a.m._
* Abbreviate time of day with lower case letters separated by periods: _a.m./p.m._
* Times on the hour should not use zeroes:  _9 – 10 a.m._
* Time not on the hour should use a colon to separate hours from minutes: _9:30 a.m._
* Do not put a 12 in front of noon:  _noon_, not _12 noon_
* Avoid the redundant:  _11 p.m. tonight_
* When the day follows the month, express it in cardinal figures: on _May 11_
* When the day precedes the month or stands alone, express it in ordinal figures or ordinal numbers: _I arrive on the fifth of May and leave on the twenty-first._
* Abbreviate the month (except March, April, May, June and July) when it appears with the date, but not when it appears alone or with the year: _I was born on Sept. 15, 1983.  I was born in September 1983.  I was born in September._
